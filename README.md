Hello I wrote this code for my finals in college. 
It is simply project for take informations from user and save in some .txt folders. And when called it show this informations in our interface.
Basiclly there are 2 options when you are entered system. These are managere log in and employeer log in or sign up. 
Managers can not sign up by interface. They have to sign up by source code. They informations can write able to in test.java main code.
I think thats all i hope it is usefull for who need it.
